Stitch (working title)
===

Stitch together printable maps from tiles centered around the target
coordinates and zoom level.

**A work in progress.**

Installation:
---

node-gd requires gd to be installed first.
See <https://github.com/y-a-v-a/node-gd#installation>.

After that a simple `npm install` should just work. You'll probably need a
recent version of node, though.
